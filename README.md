# USB KVM Auto screen switcher

This simple udev rules script automatically switches screen input through DDC/CI.
When my Microsoft Sculpt keyboard is detected, the DP input is selected. When removed, USBC input is selected.

My USB KVM is a simple one I ordered from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2NZ42TP).
